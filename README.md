# Custom Security Rule with Sentinel and Alerts

## Overview
This project creates a custom Sentinel security policy and sets up notifications for policy violations. It uses Terraform to automate the creation of the policy, Pub/Sub topic, and notification configuration.

---

## Features
- **Custom Sentinel Policy:** Detect unusual VM activity (e.g., unauthorized region deployments).
- **Alerting:** Pub/Sub-based notification for violations.
- **Integration Ready:** Designed for easy integration with SIEM systems.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Google Cloud Project and Organization**: Ensure you have access to a GCP project and organization.
2. **Terraform Installed**: Install Terraform from [Terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd custom-security-rule


Testing Considerations**


Test the Policy

-Deploy a VM instance in a non-allowed region using the GCP Console or CLI.

-Check the Security Command Center for findings and verify that the policy is triggered.


Test the Notification

-Verify that a message is published to the Pub/Sub topic when the policy is violated.

-Consume the Pub/Sub topic using a subscriber or integrate with a SIEM system.


Security Considerations

1. Policy Validation: Test policies thoroughly to avoid false positives or negatives.

2. Access Control: Restrict access to the Pub/Sub topic to necessary systems or accounts.

3. Regular Updates: Review and update policies to address evolving threats.


Outputs

1. Pub/Sub Topic: Topic name for notifications.

2. Custom Policy Name: Name of the custom security policy.


Troubleshooting

1. No Findings Triggered:

-Ensure the policy logic matches the resource configuration.

-Verify logs for relevant actions.


2. Notifications Not Delivered:

-Check Pub/Sub permissions for the notification config.

-Ensure the Pub/Sub topic exists and is active.
